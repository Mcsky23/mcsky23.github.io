Passionate about Cyber Security and computers in general, I am a senior highschool student from Romania looking to share my experiences and knowledge with the world through this blog.

When it comes to CTFs, I'm no newbie, but I'm always working to become the best version of myself and "conquer" the cybersec world. Pwn/rev fascinates me the most, with web being a very close second. I also have to mention that I'm part of an amazing CTF team called [**The Few Chosen**](https://ctftime.org/team/140885/). 

In terms of hobbies, I love skateboarding, music and clothes. I've tried my fair share of things, but this sport stuck with me the most.
